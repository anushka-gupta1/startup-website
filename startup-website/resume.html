					<h2>ABOUT ME </h2>
					<p>I am a confident university student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration at ESSEC Business School with a keen interest in marketing and business management, and a penchant for various aspects of fashion.</p>

					<p>Practical hands-on experiences during my past internships have enabled me to learn and apply new vocations. This also helped me get initiated into the dynamic world of startups and entrepreneurship and I have been fortunate to have had many opportunities to interact with stakeholders at different levels, including a Forbes 30 under 30 entrepreneur, some of who continue to be my mentors till this day. Much like my millennial cohort, I am good with technology, social media and enjoy picking up new skills and applications.</p>
					
					<p>I am an avid reader who loves to sing, dance, follow music, travel and cook with a love for adventure - I have been on multiple cross-country road-trips including to two of world's TOP3 highest motorable roads. In addition, having travelled extensively in India and visited 15+ countries, has not only broadened my horizon but has also helped me understand the cultural diversity the world has to offer. </p>
					
					<p>I find fashion and marketing quite intriguing and wish to learn more by taking up internship opportunities in the same.</p>
